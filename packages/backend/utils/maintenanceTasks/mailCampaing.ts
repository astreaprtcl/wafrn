<p>Ok so you clicked, that's good. Lets get into it!</p>
<p>We have been doing lots of improvements! Bluesky integration? faster and less janky! Things? better. Users? more!</p>
<p>First of all, we have fixed a bug that didnt allow users to delete rewoots. That one was annoying!</p>
<p>We also have introduced a few new bugs and fixed them! As example when editing a post attached medias got deleted. Not anymore!</p>
<p>There are a lot of cool new options. Options like hiding who you follow and who follows you, options to hide notifications of people you dont follow, and notification filtering!</p>
<h2>Come back to <a  target="_blank" href="https://app.wafrn.net">wafrn</a>, we miss you!</h2>
<p>The wafrn team has grown up, its a lot more than just gabboman... Thats why, in the part of these emails where I said "give me money", I am going to say "give money to the team!"</p>
