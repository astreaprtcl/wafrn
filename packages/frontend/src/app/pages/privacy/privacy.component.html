    <p class="mb-3">Regarding our privacy policy:</p>
    <p class="mb-3">We will check your ip against a well known vpn checking service, to avoid abuse.</p>
    <p class="mb-3">We do not use cookies nor third party analytic tools.</p>
    <p class="mb-3">Regarding what we will do with your data:</p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      We are connected with other social networks, so your posts and your images could be automatically stored in other
      servers. Your URL, your blog name and your avatar are public information. Your birth date, email and password are
      private and only get stored in our server.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      If you chose to enable bluesky <a href="/profile/enable-bluesky">here</a>, the post you publish marked as public
      will also go to bluesky, another decentralized(ish at the moment of writing) social network.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      We will store your email and every once in a while send you a small campaign so you come back and commit some
      shitposts (please. please, do commit more shitposts).
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      We need your birth date for legal reasons. Mostly to verify that you are older than 18 for safety reasons
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      We will also store your registration IP, your last login IP and the IP that you use when you upload an attachment.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      If your account does not get activated in a period between a month and a year it might get deleted.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      If you want to get all the data we have about you, or there is any problem regarding the GDPR please email us at
      info&#64;wafrn.net. This is a manual process and can take some time.
    </p>
    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <p class="mb-3">
      Don't be a Nazi asshole. Don't harass other people. Put CW on adult things and go nuts, make nuts, show nuts. This
      project is a hobby project. Do not get the police on my doorstep.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      You can upload spicy art. Just mark it as such. Regarding "adult like characters and child like characters in
      spicy art" the answer is no.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">Do not give me a huge headache repeatedly</p>
